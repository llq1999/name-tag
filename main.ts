    basic.showString("I started to get into computer world was in junior high school. My first computer was Apple II, I tried Basic language to program Artificial Intelligence and 3D Modular. During the college year, I was particularly interested in the computer courses like Computer Languages, Numerical Analysis and Data Structure. Graduate School of National Taiwan University, Department of Agricultural Engineering, famous for her profound and reputed academic achievement, strengthens my knowledge on Computer and Hydraulics Engineering. Under Advisor Prof. Victor Jen Yih, with his high standard of academic requirement and generous personality, I came to realize the profundity of academically study and the importance of being humble. Shuttling through the cold winter chill as well as the beautiful summer campus, I sought every chance to examine all aspects of hydraulics, including Rainfall-Runoff, Water Quality Modelings. I also took application courses like Numerical Methods, Finite Difference Schemes and Computer  Communication Networks from the Civil Engineering and Electrical Engineering. Other than the academic pursue, various jobs had been attended during these time. They includes Research Assistant and Programmer. It was here that I was trained for professional programming skills. All these knowledge and impacts on my personality have great influences on me in such a way that I am still sorting it out today.I leave the Army in June, 1994, and was recruited into Prof. Jan-Tai Kuo's research team as a Research Assistant for Water Resources Bureau. The main task was to develop a dynamic routing scheme to better simulate the water quantity of rain falls in the Fei-Tsui Reservoir and its data transferring through computer networks. I used Microsoft Visual Basic to program water quality models. About computer networks, I used HTML language to design the homepage for Water Resources Bureau. It is observed that with better quantity simulation better results could be obtained for water quality that matches better with field samplings. Since field samplings were required, I was also responsible for locating and coordinating various resources into working order. Thanks to all the helps we got, the project was well done. Personally I acquired more in depth understanding on Windows programming through this research. In WANG near 2 years job, I participate many Client/Server case, for instance Far East air line Data Ware Housing, Post system, Water  system and MOTC etc.... They use Sybase or Ms SQL server, Case tool is Power Designer, Client tool is Power Builder, in MOTC case my job including SA, SD and coding main programs, from those case I think I am very powerful to use these tool, and well in team work coordination.With these experiences, I think that it's very important for an individual to have the ability to handle situations on one's own. But a humble and modest attitude together with a query, open mind would last longer. However, equally important is the ability and skill to work and coordinate with others. Not necessarily being a leader, but as a follower as well if that gets the work done well. This is my motto. In the long run, I would like to work industriously to be able to offer my knowledge and ability to as many people as I possibly can, to make solid contribution to the society, and to help build a better environment for the world. Following this thought, I think I could contribute more. And that's the basis for my applying for the position in your prestigious firm. I look forward to the chance of working with you.")
